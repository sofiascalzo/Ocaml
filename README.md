# Ocaml

This repository is dedicated exclusively to exercises and examples written in OCaml, a powerful functional programming language that combines expressive syntax with robust type safety. The content is designed to demonstrate and explore key principles of functional programming, such as immutability, recursion, first-class functions, and type inference. 

This repository also include a **custom interpreter**, designed to evaluate and process expressions represented as **abstract syntax trees (ASTs)**.
